## Objectives

Write a program that ﬁnds the speedups and efﬁciencies of this program for various values of `n` and `p`. Run your program with n= 10, 20, 40, . . . ,320, and p= 1,2,4, . . .,128.
- Suppose the run-time of a serial program is given by `Tserial= n2`, where the units of the run-time are in microseconds.
- Suppose that a parallelization of this program has run-time `Tparallel= (n2/p) + log2(p)`.
