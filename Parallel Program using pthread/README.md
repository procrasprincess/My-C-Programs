## Objectives

Write a parallel program using pthread to accomplish the same as the following serial program:
- For the serial program, the user enters a line and the program outputs the number of occurrences of each character.
- For the parallel program if we have n threads we should divide the line into n segments and let each thread counts the characters of its segment.
